# Tokyo Olympic Microsoft Azure


In this project, I utilized datasets related to the Tokyo Olympics and COVID-19, sourced from Kaggle and the ECDC website. I use Microsoft Azure services to create pipelines, manage storage, perform data transformations, utilize MySQL, and integrate with Power BI.

The main purpose of this project is to get familiar with the services of Microsoft Azure and how to use them in real world scenario. 

The task involves:
* Download datasets from kaggle and ECDC website.
* Create account on Microsoft Azure
* Create envirnments to use the Azure's services.
* Use AzureDataFactory for the creation of pipelines, link services, datasets and triggers.
* Use AzureDataFactory's services called DataFlow for the transformation of the data. 
* Use AzureDatabricks for the transformation of the data.
* Use Snypse Analytics for the transformation of the data.
* Use HD Insights for the transformation of the data.
* Use AzureMySQL and MicrosoftPowerBI for the creation of the dashboard.
